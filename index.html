                    My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer. 
                    I love to draw and all that is connected with the design.
                    In this area a long time ago and during this time 
                    I managed to create several successful projects used by people all over the world. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. 
                    As I see it,people, it's like my work. Naturally do not want
                    to rest on our laurels and will continue further studies to improve soybean skills, 
                    creating new interesting creative projects.

                        Lately, I often create templates for WordPress.
                        The portfolio is the presentation and the opportunity
                        to buy them on the site Themeforest.

                        Creating a brand is a very complex process aimed at 
                        the creation and positioning the unique persons of the company, 
                        its products and services.

                    </p>
                    <span>
                        Everyone is able to destroy the dream, but not everyone is able to create it. 
                        I try to help people in its definition as a person and specialist.
